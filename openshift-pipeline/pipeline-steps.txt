Pre requisite:
-------------
IMPORTANT(namespace "serverless-demo" is used in this example, substitute with yours ) 

1.Prior to doing any steps verify jenkins is available in the namespace.
If unavailable , install jenkins with the below command in the namespace, and wait till it is up and running.
"oc new-app jenkins-persistent -p ENABLE_OAUTH=false -e JENKINS_PASSWORD=openshiftpipelines -n serverless-demo"

2.Ensure postgresql DB is installed in the same namespace.

3.Kafka cluster is created with Operators , and Topic "product-price-updated" is created

Pipeline steps
--------------
Step 1:
"oc new-app java~https://github.ibm.com/100mc/openshift-serverless-catalog-service.git -n serverless-demo --as-deployment-config=true"
This creates a service with name openshift-serverless-catalog-service in namespace serverless-demo

Step 2:
"oc expose service openshift-serverless-catalog-service -n serverless-demo"
This creates a route to access the service externally

Step 3:
Refer catalog service pipeline (catalog-service-pipeline.yaml) which 
which will create a build config named 'catalog-service-pipeline'.This will 
be triggered during code commit.This pipeline file has embedded jenkins file which builds and 
deploys new code. 

"oc create -f catalog-service-pipeline.yaml"		

Step 4:
Go to Build Webhook in catalog-service-pipeline.
Select Generic: 
copy webhook with secret and paste in github> project > settings> webhook	

Step 5:
Do code Commit.
Verify whether changes are reflect after pipeline is completed.
